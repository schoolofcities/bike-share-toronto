      December, 2024</p></div> <div class="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-2isjg0"><p>As cycling becomes an increasingly popular mode of transportation in Toronto, one trend is gaining significant traction: the rise of electric bikes (e-bikes) within Toronto&#39;s Bike Share system. Recent data shared by Bike Share Toronto from June 2024 has given us a detailed look at how these e-bikes, known as EFIT, compare to their classic non-electric counterparts, the ICONIC bikes.</p> <p>Overall, in June 2024, there were <a href="https://schoolofcities.github.io/bike-share-toronto/trips-062024" target="_blank">more than 762,000 Bike Share trips in Toronto</a>. 17.4% of these trips were by e-bikes. Looking at the relative characteristics of these trips and reveals some intriguing patterns that could shape the future of urban mobility in Toronto.</p> <p>One of the most notable differences between e-bikes and classic bikes is the distance covered during trips. On average, e-bike users tend to ride
      further, capitalizing on the extra power that electric motors provide.
      These longer trips suggest that e-bikes are enabling riders to explore
      parts of the city that might have been less accessible via traditional
      pedal bikes. Whether it&#39;s covering more ground on commutes or leisurely
      rides, the data reflects how e-bikes are expanding the possibilities for
      cycling trips across Toronto.</p></div> <div class="chart-container svelte-1h50wyy"><div class="line-chart"><p class="graph-title svelte-4bkcju">Distribution of trips by distance</p> <div class="svg-container"><svg></svg></div> <div class="button-container"><button class="button button-on svelte-4bkcju">Normalized by type of bike
        </button> <button class="button button-off svelte-4bkcju">Total number of trips
        </button> </div></div></div> <div class="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-auh9hp"><p>Interestingly, despite these longer trips, there is little difference in
      the duration of e-bike trips compared to classic bikes. Riders are thus traveling faster on e-bikes on average, which makes sense given their
      assisted pedaling capabilities.   
      Higher speeds not only allow cyclists to
      reach destinations quicker but could also make cycling more attractive to
      those who may have previously found it too time-consuming or physically
      demanding. With e-bikes, the barriers to entry for cycling are lowered,
      making it a more practical and inclusive option for a broader demographic.</p></div> <div class="chart-container svelte-1h50wyy"><div class="line-chart"><p class="graph-title svelte-4bkcju">Distribution of trips by duration</p> <div class="svg-container"><svg></svg></div> <div class="button-container"><button class="button button-on svelte-4bkcju">Normalized by type of bike
        </button> <button class="button button-off svelte-4bkcju">Total number of trips
        </button> </div></div></div> <div class="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-p3vaow"><p>Another key insight from the data is that e-bike trips tend to involve
      slightly more elevation gain. In a city like Toronto, where hills and
      slopes can make cycling more challenging, the extra boost from an e-bike&#39;s
      motor can make a big difference. For example, riders can now tackle
      steeper routes, such as those leading to neighborhoods like Rosedale or
      the Scarborough Bluffs, with greater ease. This ability to flatten out the
      city’s topography opens up new opportunities for riders, making cycling a
      more attractive option in areas that were previously considered difficult
      to navigate on a bike.</p></div> <div class="chart-container svelte-1h50wyy"><div class="line-chart"><p class="graph-title svelte-4bkcju">Distribution of trips by elevation gain</p> <div class="svg-container"><svg></svg></div> <div class="button-container"><button class="button button-on svelte-4bkcju">Normalized by type of bike

        </button> </div></div></div> <div class="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-1jg8t22"><p>The data also shows some intriguing differences in the time of day when e-bikes are used. While we’re still investigating the reasons behind this
      trend, it could be related to the availability of bikes at different
      stations during peak and off-peak hours. E-bikes may also be more popular
      for commuters who are looking for a reliable and faster way to get to work
      or run errands during busy periods. Understanding these temporal patterns
      will be crucial as we explore how to optimize the distribution and
      availability of e-bikes throughout the day.</p></div>  <div class="radial-title svelte-1h50wyy" data-svelte-h="svelte-1k7a1ql"><h4>24-hour trip distributions</h4></div>  <div class="radial-legend svelte-1h50wyy" data-svelte-h="svelte-km4dgp"><div class="legend-item svelte-1h50wyy"><svg class="legend-circ svelte-1h50wyy"><circle cx="20" cy="15" r="8" fill="var(--brandDarkGreen)" fill-opacity="0.1" stroke="var(--brandDarkGreen)" stroke-width="2"></circle></svg> <p class="svelte-1h50wyy">ICONIC</p></div> <div class="legend-item svelte-1h50wyy"><svg class="legend-circ svelte-1h50wyy"><circle cx="20" cy="15" r="8" fill="darkorange" fill-opacity="0.1" stroke="darkorange" stroke-width="2"></circle></svg> <p class="svelte-1h50wyy">EFIT</p></div></div>  <div class="radial-container svelte-1h50wyy"> </div>  <div class="flex-container-weekday svelte-1h50wyy"></div> <div class="flex-container-weekend svelte-1h50wyy"></div> <div class="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-115tlni"><p>These findings reflect broader shifts in how cycling is being integrated
      into urban mobility strategies. The introduction of e-bikes in Toronto is
      not just about offering a new mode of transportation—it’s about making
      cycling more accessible, efficient, and appealing to a wider range of
      people. Whether it’s older adults who may need extra assistance with
      pedaling, people with longer commutes, or those who want to avoid arriving
      at their destination sweaty, e-bikes have the potential to address many of
      the challenges that have historically limited bike usage in the city.</p> <p>From a sustainability perspective, the growing use of e-bikes aligns with
      Toronto’s push towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By providing a
      viable alternative to cars for longer trips, e-bikes can help cut down on
      vehicle emissions, especially during peak traffic hours. As the city works
      towards its ambitious net-zero targets, the role of EV bikes in
      encouraging a shift from motorized transport to more sustainable,
      human-powered options cannot be understated.</p> <p>As we continue to analyze the data and explore the impacts of e-bikes on
      Toronto’s cycling culture, the early results are encouraging. E-bikes are
      not just another addition to the Bike Share system—they represent a step
      towards a more dynamic, sustainable, and inclusive urban mobility
      landscape. Stay tuned as we delve deeper into the numbers and uncover more
      about how e-bikes are reshaping the way Torontonians move through their
      city.</p></div> <div class="text" data-svelte-h="svelte-zd7fuk"><br> <br> <h3>Data &amp; Methodology</h3> <p>Bike Share Toronto shared with us data on all Bike Share trips in June 2024, which included for each trip, start station, end station, duration, and type of bike (EFIT or ICONIC). We additionally computed the network distance and elevation gain of each trip via Graphhopper, a network analysis software (<a href="https://schoolofcities.github.io/bike-share-toronto/trips-062024" target="_blank">as described in this post</a>).</p> <p>All the charts shown on this page were created via analyzing data in Python and visualizing with D3. All medians and distributions shown for each category are significantly different from each other via Mann-Whitney U (for testing difference in medians) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (for testing difference in distributions) tests.</p> <p>Code and data for this page are on <a href="https://github.com/schoolofcities/bike-share-toronto" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p> <br> <br> <br></div> </main>
